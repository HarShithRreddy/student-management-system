# Student Management System (CLI)

This is a **command-line based Python project** designed to manage student records efficiently.
The project applies core Python concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, and JSON-based data persistence**.

The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills and demonstrate the ability to build a complete, structured Python application.
